# Random-Number-Generator

Hello!

This bit of code can be used to choose random numbers from within a range.

To use, type in the Python shell
```Python
rng(end,winners)
```

rng is the name of the function.
end is the highest number that you wish to use.
winners are the number of winners to be chosen.

So to search for 2 winners in 100 entries type

```Python
rng(100,2)
```

Made really quickly to meet a need.
